this is my next file

first stage is untrackable file

to see the stage:
>>git status

"u==>"untrackable",
m==>"modified",
a==>"add""

to add the file to the githubclone
for every changes need to give this command
>>git add filename.extension

need save:
>>git commit -m "commit message"

to save to github from githubclone:
>>git push origin main

origin is first folder
main is  subfolder of origin
